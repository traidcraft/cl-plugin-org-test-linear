## Quick Reference (DO/DON'T)

### DO (Patterns to Follow)

<!-- Accumulated from PR consolidation -->

- Read this knowledge base before starting work on any issue
- Use the CodeLantern MCP (`mcp__cl__*`) for all issue and PR operations — never use `mcp__github__*`
- Use Context7 MCP for library documentation lookups
- Capture learnings in PR descriptions (Learnings section)
- Follow existing patterns — check this KB first
- Keep PRs focused — one issue per PR
- Write clear commit messages that explain "why"

### DON'T (Mistakes to Avoid)

<!-- Accumulated from PR consolidation -->

- Don't hardcode project/repository values — read from `.codelantern/config.json`
- Don't skip the planning phase for non-trivial features
- Don't merge without updating the knowledge base
- Don't introduce new patterns without documenting them here
- Don't leave the Learnings section empty in PRs

## MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide AI agents with specialized tools.

| Server | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **CodeLantern** (`mcp__cl__*`) | All issue, PR, and project board operations | Create PRs, manage issues, search code, labels, project operations |
| **Context7** | Library documentation | Need up-to-date docs for any library or framework |

### CodeLantern MCP

All issue, PR, and project board operations go through the CodeLantern MCP server. Always use `mcp__cl__*` tools — never fall back to `mcp__github__*` or other MCP tools for these operations.

**Common operations:**
- `mcp__cl__create_pull_request` / `mcp__cl__update_pull_request` — PR management
- `mcp__cl__search_issues` — Find issues with specific criteria
- `mcp__cl__create_issue` / `mcp__cl__update_issue` — Issue management
- `mcp__cl__create_labels` — Label management
- `mcp__cl__configure_project` — Project board setup

**Best for:** PR workflows, issue management, label operations, project board operations.

### Context7 MCP

Provides current, version-specific documentation and code examples.

**Usage pattern:**
```
# First resolve the library ID
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id(libraryName: "react", query: "useEffect cleanup")

# Then query documentation
mcp_context7_query-docs(libraryId: "/facebook/react", query: "useEffect cleanup examples")
```

**Best for:** API references, code patterns, configuration guides, troubleshooting.

## Common Tasks (Recipes)

### Starting Work on an Issue

1. Run `/codelantern:refresh` to understand current state (if resuming work)
2. If no active work, run `/codelantern:architect` to create a technical plan for the next Ready issue
3. Run `/codelantern:implement` to execute the plan
4. Fill in Learnings section before marking PR ready

### Adding a New Pattern

1. Document it in the relevant section of this KB
2. Add to "DO (Patterns to Follow)" if it's a best practice
3. If replacing an old pattern, update rather than add
4. Link to the source PR in the changelog

### Updating the Knowledge Base

After merging a PR:
1. Run `/codelantern:consolidate` from the feature branch
2. Review extracted learnings
3. Commit the KB updates
